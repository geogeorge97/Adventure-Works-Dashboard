# Adventure-Works-Dashboard

Created an interactive Power BI dashboard to track KPIs like Revenue, Profit, and Return rate using Sales,
Product, and Returns data of a Bike Shop. Used Power Query to perform Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)
processes; created Relational Data Models. Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) used to create calculated
columns and measures. Separate dashboard pages with dynamic charts, filters, slicers and maps were utilized
to compare regional performance, understand customer behavior, and analyze product-level trends.
